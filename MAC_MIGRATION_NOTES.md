# MAC-Based Device Identification Migration Complete

The database has been migrated to use MAC addresses as the primary device identifier.

## Key Changes:
1. MAC address is now the unique identifier for devices
2. IP addresses can change without creating duplicate device entries
3. Device IP change history is tracked in device_ip_history table
4. Duplicate devices with same MAC have been merged

## Scanner Updates Required:
The scanner logic needs to be updated to:
1. Look up devices by MAC address first, then IP address
2. Update existing device IP when MAC matches but IP differs
3. Log IP changes to device_ip_history table
4. Handle devices without MAC addresses gracefully

## Monitoring Implications:
- Devices will maintain their monitoring history across IP changes
- Alerts will be associated with the device regardless of current IP
- Custom names and settings are preserved across IP changes

## Next Steps:
1. Update scanner.py process_discovered_device() method
2. Test with a device that changes IP address
3. Verify monitoring data continuity
4. Check alert associations remain intact
